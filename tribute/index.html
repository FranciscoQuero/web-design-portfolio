      <h2>A tribute song</h2>
<p>
        There is a famous tribute song dedicated to all these olive harvesters from Jaen that were the base of the current society of Jaén. This is the lyrics translation:<br>
  </p><p class="italic">
Andalusians of Jaén,<br>
proud harvesters of olives,<br>
tell me from your soul, then,<br>
who made the olive groves?<br>
<br>
They did not come from nothing,<br>
from money, nor the masters,<br>
only from the silent earth,<br>
and from sweat and toil. <br>
<br>
United with pure water,<br>
united with the planets,<br>
the three made the beauty<br>
of the twining trunks.<br>
<br>
Rise, white olive tree,<br>
they said at the wind’s feet.<br>
And the olive raised an arm<br>
weighty as concrete.<br>
<br>
Andalusians of Jaén,<br>
proud harvesters of olives,<br>
tell me from your soul, then,<br>
who nursed the olive groves?<br>
<br>
Your blood, your lives,<br>
not the exploiters’<br>
who were enriched by<br>
your sweat’s generous stream.<br>
<br>
Not that of the owner<br>
who buried you in poverty,<br>
who beat at your brows,<br>
who lowered your gaze.<br>
<br>
Trees that your zeal<br>
blessed at midday<br>
were the source of bread<br>
that only others ate.<br>
<br>
How many ages of olives,<br>
fettered feet and hands,<br>
suns on suns, and moons on moons<br>
weigh on your bones?<br>
<br>
Andalusians of Jaén,<br>
proud harvesters of olives,<br>
tell me from your soul, then,<br>
whose are these olive groves?<br>
<br>
Jaén, rise bravely<br>
from your lunar stone,<br>
you’ll not be enslaved<br>
nor all your olive groves.<br>
<br>
Within the clarity<br>
of oil and its aromas,<br>
they reveal your liberty<br>
the liberty of your loam.
