## Welcome to my web design portfolio

This is a repository that stores my small portfolio of small web design projects. They were mainly built as result of the Free Code Camp course in order to get the certification.

### Projects

- [Page in tribute to Andalusian olives harvesters](https://franciscoquero.github.io/web-design-portfolio/tribute/): a simple HTML page with an image and some basic CSS design.
